# SampleSize
Run analyses and plot for sample size selection (Figure 2 of Barbosa, J., Stein, H., Zorowitz, S. et al. A practical guide for studying human behavior in the lab. Behav Res (2022). https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-022-01793-9; also available as preprint at https://psyarxiv.com/tcmvp/)).

The main (poweranalysis.m) code runs in Matlab. 
In panel B, the estimated difference in DDM drift for each simulation is stored in DDMeffectsize_simulations.csv. 
You can generate new DDM simulations and fits using the Python script power_analysis_ddm.py which uses the PyDDM package.
