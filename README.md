# SampleSize
Run analyses and plot for sample size selection (Figure 2 of [Barbosa et al., psyarxiv](https://psyarxiv.com/tcmvp/))

The main (poweranalysis.m) code runs in Matlab. 
In panel B, the estimated difference in DDM drift for each simulation is stored in DDMeffectsize_simulations.csv. 
You can generate new DDM simulations and fits using the Python script power_analysis_ddm.py which uses the PyDDM package.
